# Capstone Project 

### Project Objective

The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.

Since the data holds label we will use supervised learning.

The dataset for this project originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository
